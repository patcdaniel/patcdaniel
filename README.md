### Hi,

I'm Patrick. I am currently a PhD student in the Ocean Science department at the University of California Santa Cruz. My research focus is on how phytoplankton communities vary at different scales in both time and space. To do this, our research group deploys instruments that take thousands of pictures of phytoplankton every hour and we use machine learning methods to classify the images.
